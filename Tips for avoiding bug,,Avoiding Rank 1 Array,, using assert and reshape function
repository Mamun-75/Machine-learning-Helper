"""
we should not use rank 1 array
if we are not sure about dimension, we can use assert function which is a debug tool
assert condition, "Error message if condition is False"
assert(a.shape==(5,1))
What is assert in Python?
assert is a debugging tool that tests if a condition is True.

If the condition is True → nothing happens.

If the condition is False → Python raises an AssertionError.

its a good way


we have another way
dont feel shy using reshape function

a = a.reshape((5,1))
it will ensure the dimension, and act as a debug weapon
